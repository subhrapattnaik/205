This is a blank canvas as of now. And as we are making
our version of the Ludo game we’ll change it by just
keeping a single line of boxes on both the sides of the
Home and have a little race on who reaches first to the
home base by rolling the dice.


To create these boxes we’ll write two functions leftBoard()
and rightBoard().

leftBoard() function will create the board for player one
and rightBoard() will create board for player two.
